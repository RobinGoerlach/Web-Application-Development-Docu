"Vanilla JavaScript" refers to using JavaScript in its purest form, without any additional frameworks or libraries like React, Angular, or jQuery. It means you're working only with standard JavaScript code that the browser understands, without relying on extra tools. The term "vanilla" suggests "plain" or "unmodified," and the focus is on learning JavaScript functions and concepts directly before incorporating libraries that add more functionality.
